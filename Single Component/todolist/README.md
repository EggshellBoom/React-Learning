#### a simple todo list app that satisfies the points below
* In the text box, enter a task and hit return to add the task to the list
* Click the checkbox in front of a task to complete it, which reduces the number of remaining tasks by 1 and the task should disappear from the list. (The list should only show incomplete tasks).
* Click the checkbox in front of 'Mark All Done' to complete all, which sets the number of remaining tasks to 0 and remove all tasks from the list
* Click 'Clear Completed Todos' to reset the completed tasks from the list, which means all previously completed tasks are now incomplete and therefore re-appear in the list.
