## timer
[Portal to Timer Demo](https://eggshellboom.github.io/timer/)
This is a simple timer app created using a single react component. The basic functionalities are:
* UI that shows the current number in the timer.
*	Button that toggles the timer. If the time has not started yet or has been stopped, the text on the button should be "start". Otherwise the text should be "stop".
*	Reset button that resets the number of the time to 0. If one press the reset button while the timer is running, the time should not stop and will start from 0 again.
*	Suppose that one started the timer and stopped it at 3 (second), when one start the timer again without reset, the timer should continue running start from 3.
